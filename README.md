# Emulation and debugging library for Z80

## Status: WIP

## Compatibility
The project is written in Rust and should be compatible with any platform that supports Rust.

## Description
The project is a library that provides emulation and debugging capabilities for the Z80 CPU.  
The library is designed to be used in other projects that require Z80 emulation and debugging.
The IO and Memory can be easily extended to support custom devices and memory configurations.

## This project will serve as my Computer Science Bachelor's project.
